%Hurston, Zora Neale
%%from Their Eyes Were Watching God

Ships at a distance have every man’s wish on board. For some they come in with the tide. For others they sail forever
on the horizon, never out of sight, never landing until the Watcher turns his eyes away in resignation, his dreams
mocked to death by Time. That is the life of men.

Now, women forget all those things they don’t want to remember, and remember everything they don’t want to forget.
The dream is the truth. Then they act and do things accordingly.

So the beginning of this was a woman and she had come back from burying the dead. Not the dead of sick and ailing
with friends at the pillow and the feet. She had come back from the sodden and the bloated; the sudden dead, their
eyes flung wide open in judgment.

The people all saw her come because it was sundown. The sun was gone, but he had left his footprints in the sky. It
was the time for sitting on porches beside the road. It was the time to hear things and talk. These sitters had been
tongueless, earless, eyeless conveniences all day long. Mules and other brutes had occupied their skins. But now,
the sun and the bossman were gone, so the skins felt powerful and human. They became lords of sounds and lesser
things. They passed nations through their mouths. They sat in judgment.

Seeing the woman as she was made them remember the envy they had stored up from other times. So they chewed
up the back parts of their minds and swallowed with relish. They made burning statements with questions, and killing
tools out of laughs. It was mass cruelty. A mood come alive, Words walking without masters; walking altogether like
harmony in a song.
