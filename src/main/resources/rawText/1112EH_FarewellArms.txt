%%from A Farewell to Arms

Sometimes in the dark we heard the troops marching under the window and guns going past pulled by motor-tractors.
There was much traffic at night and many mules on the roads with boxes of ammunition on each side of their
pack-saddles and gray motor trucks that carried men, and other trucks with loads covered with canvas that moved
slower in the traffic. There were big guns too that passed in the day drawn by tractors, the long barrels of the guns
covered with green branches and green leafy branches and vines laid over the tractors. To the north we could look
across a valley and see a forest of chestnut trees and behind it another mountain on this side of the river. There was
fighting for that mountain too, but it was not successful, and in the fall when the rains came the leaves all fell from the chestnut trees and the branches were bare and the trunks black with rain. The vineyards were thin and bare-branched
too and all the country wet and brown and dead with the autumn. There were mists over the river and clouds on the
mountain and the trucks splashed mud on the road and the troops were muddy and wet in their capes; their rifles
were wet and under their capes the two leather cartridge-boxes on the front of the belts, gray leather boxes heavy
with the packs of clips of thin, long 6.5 mm. cartridges, bulged forward under the capes so that the men, passing on
the road, marched as though they were six months gone with child.
